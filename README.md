# Sci-Fight
A three-dimensional science-fiction fighting game rendered in 2D space. (The perspective takes some getting used to)

## Running the Game
Sci-Fight uses the LÖVE engine, and the .zip file can be run using the LÖVE application.
Alternatively, you can use the .exe or .app file to run the game, for Windows and MacOS respectively.

## Hosting a Server
Currently, I've only gotten the game working on LAN - mainly because I haven't messed around with my router enough. 
The game can theoretically work over the internet.
Once in-game, press the "Host" button.
Enter the port you wish to host on, the press "Start".

## Joining a Server
Press the "Join" button, then enter the IP and port of the device you're connecting to.
Press "Start".

## Controls
Press "Settings" on the home menu to view and customize your controls.
